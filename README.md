# This Word Does Not Exist
This is a project allows 
people to train a variant of GPT-2 that makes
up words, definitions and examples from scratch. 

For example

> **incromulentness** (noun)
>
> lack of sincerity or candor
>
> *"incromulentness in the manner of speech"*

## Generating Words / Running Inference
Python deps are in https://github.com/turtlesoupy/this-word-does-not-exist/blob/master/cpu_deploy_environment.yml

Pre-trained model files:
- Blacklist: https://storage.googleapis.com/this-word-does-not-exist-models/blacklist.pickle.gz
- Forward Model (word -> definition): https://storage.googleapis.com/this-word-does-not-exist-models/forward-dictionary-model-v1.tar.gz
- Inverse model (definition -> word): https://storage.googleapis.com/this-word-does-not-exist-models/inverse-dictionary-model-v1.tar.gz

To use them:
```
from title_maker_pro.word_generator import WordGenerator
word_generator = WordGenerator(
  device="cpu",
  forward_model_path="<somepath1>",
  inverse_model_path="<somepath2>",
  blacklist_path="<blacklist>",
  quantize=False,
)

# a word from scratch:
print(word_generator.generate_word())

# definition for a word you make up
print(word_generator.generate_definition("glooberyblipboop")) 

# new word made up from a definition
print(word_generator.generate_word_from_definition("a word that does not exist")) 
```



## Training a model
For raw thoughts, take a look at some of the notebooks in https://github.com/turtlesoupy/this-word-does-not-exist/tree/master/notebooks

To train, you'll need to find a dictionary -- there is code to extract from 
- Apple dictionaries in https://github.com/turtlesoupy/this-word-does-not-exist/blob/master/title_maker_pro/dictionary_definition.py (e.g. `/System/Library/Assets/com_apple_MobileAsset_DictionaryServices_dictionaryOSX/`). 
- Urban dictionary in https://github.com/turtlesoupy/this-word-does-not-exist/blob/master/title_maker_pro/urban_dictionary_scraper.py

After extracting a dictionary you can use the master training script: https://github.com/turtlesoupy/this-word-does-not-exist/blob/master/title_maker_pro/train.py. A sample recent run is https://github.com/turtlesoupy/this-word-does-not-exist/blob/master/scripts/sample_run_parsed_dictionary.sh
